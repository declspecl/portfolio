# Why am I afraid of the things I yearn for?

I want to enjoy the present, but I'm afraid of falling behind.
I want to be successful, but what's the point if I'm alone?

I want to have friends, but I'm afraid to call someone my friend.
I want to spend time with others, but I'm afraid of not getting another invite.

I want to be in a relationship, but I wouldn't believe it if someone wanted to be with me.
I want to share everything with someone, but I'm afraid of being a burden.

I want to express my emotions, but I'm afraid of being vulnerable.
I want to be vulnerable, but I'm afraid of being seen as imperfect and ugly inside.

I want to be happy, but I'm afraid of becoming discontent.
I want to talk about it, but I'm afraid of being cringe.
I want to solve it myself like everything else, but I'm afraid I can't.

<br />

I think I'm afraid of the things I yearn for because I'm afraid of losing them
