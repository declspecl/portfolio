# Writing Java Can Actually be Enjoyable!

Written 11/15/2024

I used to dislike writing Java.
It's clunky, old, verbose, has tons of boilerplate, and is just not fun to write (cue Java bureaucracy).
I also have some fundamental complaints about the language since I'm a nerd about programming language design:

- Shoving heavy OOP down your throat (but don't get me wrong, what <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/top-level-statements#start-exploring" target="_blank">C# is doing with top-level statements</a> is WAY worse)
- `final` is not really final, and there is no real `const`.
  `final` does not make objects immutable, it just makes the reference immutable
- This isn't a fault of the language per se, but the standard to encapsulate every field in a class, even when there is no change in behavior to just exposing the fields as public

But really, these are just nitpicks and do not largely affect the language's usability.
And in the latest LTS versions of Java, notably 17 and 21, the language has some really cool features that improve the Java DX a ton.
As I've started working at Amazon which uses Java extensively, I've also learned of many great packages that overall make Java development pretty enjoyable.

Currently, I reach for Rust for every project, but when I need to use several AWS services, or I anticipate a heavily OOP backend structure, I reach for Java.
The AWS SDK for Rust is not bad but is miles behind the Java SDK, expectedly.
Java also has a much richer ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and testing utilities for services, so I will reach for Java in cases where I feel that I will need those.

## What's Nice About Java Development

- **Optionals**:

    These have been around since Java 8, but I think they're a great and underused feature.
    They're similar to Rust's `Option` type, and they're a great way to handle nulls in a typesafe way.
    Some people have strong opinions on if we should use `Optional`s as class members, but I say why not?
    I use them exclusively instead of `null` in my code, which makes me a lot more confident about the state of my data.

    ```java
    // no ambiguity about if this method can fail or not
    public Optional<String> getMiddleName() {
        String[] parts = this.name.split(" ");
        if (parts.length == 3) {
            return Optional.of(parts[1]);
        }

        return Optional.empty();
    }
    ```

- **Records**:

    First introduced into the LTS channel with Java 17, record types are concise, immutable data carriers.
    Do you return `String`s from methods and wish there was a more descriptive way?
    Just make a record.

    ```java
    public record QueryExecutionId(String id) {}

    // ...

    public QueryExecutionId makeQuery() {
        String executionId = service.query();

        return new QueryExecutionId(executionId);
    }
    ```

    Defining a typesafe relational DB table schema?

    ```java
    public record Column(String name, int index) {}

    // ...

    public class UsersTable {
        public enum TableColumn {
            ID(new Column("id", 0)),
            NAME(new Column("name", 1)),
            EMAIL(new Column("email", 2));

            private final Column column;

            TableColumn(Column column) {
                this.column = column;
            }

            public Column getColumn() {
                return column;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    They just remove a lot of guesswork and boilerplate from your code.
    Definitely try them out if you haven't yet.

- **Streams**:

    This is a small thing, but I love the stream API: they're super ergonomic and make code easier to read.
    They feel very similar to Rust's iterators, which I also love.
    Take these examples:

    ```java
    private Set<Bar> getBarsFromCoolFoos(List<Foo> foos) {
        return foos.stream()
            .filter(foo -> foo.isCool()) // or just Foo::isCool
            .map(foo -> foo.getBar()) // or just Foo::getBar
            .collect(Collectors.toSet());
    }

    private HashMap<String, Baz> getBazByName(List<Baz> bazs) {
        return bazs.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.toMap(
                b -> b.getName(), // or just Baz::getName
                b -> b
            ));
    }
    ```

    compared to the imperative equivalent:

    ```java
    private Set<Bar> getBarsFromCoolFoos(List<Foo> foos) {
        Set<Bar> bars = new HashSet<>();

        for (Foo foo : foos) {
            if (foo.isCool()) {
                bars.add(foo.getBar());
            }
        }

        return bars;
    }

    private HashMap<String, Baz> getBazByName(List<Baz> bazs) {
        HashMap<String, Baz> bazByName = new HashMap<>();

        for (Baz baz : bazs) {
            bazByName.put(baz.getName(), baz);
        }

        return bazByName;
    }
    ```

- **Pattern matching**:

    There's more to pattern matching than just `instanceof`, but its the case I use the most.
    This was totally reproducible before pattern matching was officially added by just typecasting, but it's a lot more ergonomic now.

    ```java
    public void doSomething(SuperClass obj) {
        if (obj instanceof SubClassA a) {
            a.doActionA();
        }
        else if (obj instanceof SubClassB b) {
            b.doActionB();
        }
    }
    ```

- **var**:

    No explanation needed.
    No more `AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean` or `ConcurrentHashMap<String, List<ConcurrentHashMap<String, List<String>>>>`.
    Thank you, Java üôè

- **Dependency injection**:

    This is controversial, but I actually really like dependency injection using <a href="https://spring.io/" target="_blank">Spring</a> or <a href="https://github.com/google/guice" target="_blank">Google Guice</a>.
    The idea is kind of dumb:

    > You know, we create a lot of these object things.
    > Why don't we make them all global on startup and then pick from them when we want to!

    But in practice, especially in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture" target="_blank">Service-Oriented Architecture</a>, it's really nice to have a single place to declaratively configure all the application's working parts, and then declaratively pull them into your classes when needed.
    Although Java is definitely **not** the language people think in the whole "ship fast" mentality, I feel more efficient writing code with dependency injection than without.

- **AWS SDK**:

    Although this is a bit biased, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/" target="_blank">AWS SDK for Java</a> is fantastic, and of course since Amazon uses a ton of Java, you know the Java SDK is top notch.
    Most of the service's requests and responses fit the builder pattern really well, and in Java this is just really ergonomic.
    One great feature in the SDK for Java is the ability to <a href="https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/enhanced/dynamodb/mapper/annotations/DynamoDbBean.html" target="_blank">create DynamoDB schemas from Java classes</a>, and easily abstract the data layer.
    So for example, you could have a (minimized) <a href="https://github.com/declspecl/personle/blob/main/personle-api/src/main/java/com/declspecl/dependencies/dynamodb/DailyGuessesItem.java" target="_blank">class like this</a>:

    ```java
    @DynamoDbBean
    public class DailyGuessesItem {
        private String pk;
        private String sk;

        @DynamoDbPartitionKey
        @DynamoDbAttribute("pk")
        public String getPk() {
            return pk;
        }

        @DynamoDbSortKey
        @DynamoDbAttribute("sk")
        public String getSk() {
            return sk;
        }
    }
    ```

    and easily wire up to a typesafe DAO for every API:

    ```java
    var ddbTable = ddbClient.table(
        "myTableName",
        TableSchema.fromBean(DailyGuessesItem.class)
    );

    ddbTable.putItem(dailyGuessesItem);

    DailyGuessesItem item = ddbTable.getItem(pk, sk);
    ```

    In this case `converter` is an object that converts my domain model to the `DailyGuessesItem` you see above.

## Must-Use Packages

Barebones Java feels exactly that way, barebones.
I feel like the language just leaves you susceptible to a lot of codesmells and overly imperative code.

Here's a list of packages I use in basically every project:

- <a href="https://projectlombok.org/" target="_blank">Lombok</a>:

    A ubiquitous must-have for Java development.
    It adds a ton of useful annotations that remove a lot of boilerplate from your code, like `@EqualsAndHashCode`, `@ToString`, and `@Builder`.
    Be sure to also install the <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij" target="_blank">Lombok plugin</a> if using IntelliJ IDEA for full support.
    Some people dislike Annotation-Driven Development, the Java special, but these annotations aren't even magic; they just write the code that you would have anyways.

- <a href="https://immutables.github.io/" target="_blank">Immutables</a>:

    Immutables is my absolute go-to for domain modeling.
    It forces immutability on your objects, which reduces the chance of bugs, and provides some great QoL features.
    It has some overlap with Lombok, but my strategy is to use Lombok for data classes and Immutables for domain classes.

    This is an example of what an Immutables class looks like:

    ```java
    @Value.Immutable
    @Value.Style(init = "with*", get = { "get*", "is*" })
    public abstract class User {
        public abstract String name();
        public abstract boolean isCool();
        public abstract Optional<Integer> age();
    }

    // ...

    User user = ImmutableUser.builder()
        .withName("someName")
        .withIsCool(true)
        .withAge(21)
        .build();

    System.out.println(user.getName());
    System.out.println(user.getAge().get());
    System.out.println(user.isCool());
    ```

- <a href="https://github.com/google/guava" target="_blank">Google Guava</a>:

    Guava is a great utility library that fills the gaps of what Java's standard library is missing.
    It has a great set of caching helpers, like `CacheBuilder` and `LoadingCache`.
    It also has some nice utility functions:

    - `Preconditions.checkArgument`
    - `ImmutableList.of`
    - `ImmutableMap.of`
    - `Hashing.sha256`
    - `Hashing.hmacSha256`

- <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/" target="_blank">Apache Commons Lang</a>:

    Another small library of utility methods.
    Some useful functions from here are:

    - `StringUtils.isEmpty`
    - `StringUtils.isBlank`
    - `CollectionUtils.isEmpty`
    - `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`
    - `RandomUtils.nextInt`
